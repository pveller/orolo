# Orolo

Yet another natural language dates parser for JavaScript with a focus on understanding dates and date ranges in a sentence.

# IMPORTANT

THIS IS WORK-IN-PROGRESS AT THE MOMENT. PLEASE CHECK BACK LATER.

## Why

There are very good NLP date parses for JavaScript:

* [chrono](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono)
* [date](https://github.com/MatthewMueller/date)

There are also strong general purpose NLP frameworks and some come with pre-build named entity recognition for dates:

* [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise)
* [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural)

Unfortunately I couldn't find one that would understand these sentences:

* Will be in New York on May 5th, 6th, and 7th
* TBD [list more examples]

and that's how _orolo_ was born.

TBD
